# Residual-Network-in-Keras
A very deep convolutional network was built using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks allowed to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.  In this assignment the basic building blocks of ResNets was implemented. These building blocks are put together to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification in Keras environment.
